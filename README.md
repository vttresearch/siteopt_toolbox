# Installing the Siteopt tool

You need Spine Toolbox and Julia language for running the Siteopt tool. You also need the Git software. Install them first.

## Spine Toolbox
You need Spine Toolbox for running the toolbox project. In addition, it is needed for using the databases.

- Install Git software (https://git-scm.com/downloads). The installer asks many questions, use the default answers.
- Install Miniconda (https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/install/). Add Miniconda to path variable in Windows
- Create a Miniconda environment for Spine Toolbox and activate it. I.e., run the following in command prompt:


```
> conda init
> conda create -n spinetoolbox python=3.12
> conda activate spinetoolbox
> where python
```
The last command prints the python interpreter path, which you should make note of. The command applied in Windows. In Linux use "which python". 

N.B. If you get error CondaError: Run 'conda init' before 'conda activate', run 

```
> source activate base
> conda activate spinetoolbox
```

- Install Spine toolbox as described in https://github.com/Spine-tools/Spine-Toolbox?tab=readme-ov-file#installation-from-sources-using-git


## Python dependencies of the Siteopt tool

- Create a Miniconda environment for Siteopt python dependencies and activate it. I.e., run the following in command prompt:

```
>conda create -n spinedb python=3.11 numpy=1.26.4
>conda activate spinedb
```

Next install the Spine DB API (https://github.com/spine-tools/Spine-Database-API) and Scikit learn extra (https://scikit-learn-extra.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html)
```
>pip install git+https://github.com/spine-tools/Spine-Database-API.git
>conda install -c conda-forge scikit-learn-extra
```

Exit the console.


## Julia language

Install Julia language (at least version 1.10). See https://julialang.org/downloads/ for instructions.


## Downloading the Siteopt tool

Install Git software (https://git-scm.com/downloads). The installer asks many questions, use the default answers. Check the URL of the siteopt repository by logging into extgit.vtt.fi. Press the "Code" button to see the address. Use the one which begins with https. 

Select an empty folder in your machine. Start command prompt and 

```
git clone https://extgit.vtt.fi/...
```

(replace ... by the actual URL). 

You will now have a **siteopt_toolbox** folder.

## Siteopt dependencies installation

Go to Siteopt **code** folder of siteopt_toolbox and start Julia console (type "julia" in command prompt). Do not use the same console which you used for Spine Toolbox installation (open a new one). The packages needed by the Siteopt Julia scripts need to be installed. Run commands:
  
```
Using Pkg
Pkg.activate(".")
Pkg.add("https://github.com/spine-tools/SpineOpt.jl.git#elexia")
Pkg.add("https://github.com/spine-tools/SpinePeriods.jl.git#clustering")
Pkg.resolve()
Pkg.instantiate()
```	
Rebuilding Julia PyCall package is needed to be able to connect to the databases. This is done by running the following commands in Julia console:

```
using Pkg
using PyCall
ENV["PYTHON"] = raw"C:\path\to\your\python\python.exe" #(replace the path by the Python executable in the Miniconda environment where you installed Spine Toolbox )
Pkg.build("PyCall")
```
You can find the Python path as explained in the Spine Toolbox installation section. You can now exit Julia session.

## Input data

Check that you have all the necessary input files in the **current_input** folder of siteopt_toolbox.


# Running the Siteopt tool

Spine Toolbox provides a graphical user interface for running SpineOpt and editing databases. 

Activate the proper Miniconda environment, which you used to install Spine Toolbox. Start Spine Toolbox by command

```
> conda activate spinetoolbox
> spinetoolbox
```

in console (e.g. "cmd" in Windows).

Install SpineOpt plugin (Plugins->Install pluginâ€¦, select SpineOpt). 
Now Open the Siteopt toolbox project (File->open). You select a folder, not a file when opening a project.
Go to File->Settings. Go to Tools tab. Check that in **Julia** box the second line points to the code folder (See figure below).

XXX


Select each of the databases one at a time. In "data store properties" click "New Spine db". A new dialogue opens. Click "Save".
